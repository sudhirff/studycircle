Once your basic concepts are strong, any problem can be solved by applying the principles.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Solve Previous Yearâ€™s Papers:</strong> Try to attempt as many previous yearsâ€™ papers for KVPY as you can. Solving them in an exam-like environment will make you evaluate your level of preparedness and also help you discover your strengths and weaknesses.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Practice Diligently:</strong> Apart from the syllabus, go through numerical and multiple-choice questions given at the back of almost all reference books for Classes 11 and 12.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Study from the Right Books:</strong> Only study from books and study material of repute. Donâ€™t waste your time and energy in going through irrelevant study material, as this will leave you confused, and might also deplete your confidence.</li>
