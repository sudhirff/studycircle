                    <h6 class="text-org">Support your child's learning at home.</h6>
                    <p>In a world of distractions, itâ€™s hard for parents to be sure that their Childâ€™s are focusing on the right kind of fun â€“ something age appropriate, for example! While itâ€™s great to let your child explore, why not let it happen over a slightly controlled environment?</p>
                    <p>â€˜Controlâ€™ doesnâ€™t necessarily negate fun anymore, after all. Just look at Meritest to prove that. Its content for students is as varied as it is vast, and we think itâ€™s an interesting take on studentâ€™s education in a digital world.</p>
